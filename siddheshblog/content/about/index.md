I am Siddhesh Kanawade, a undergraduate in the discipline of Electrical Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar with minors in Computer Science. Over time, I have developed a particular curiosity in cloud, application development and web security. I am constantly trying to expand my knowledge through online courses and projects. I also deeply enjoy designing and led a team of 15 students for Amalthea, IIT Gandhinagarâ€™s technical summit. To sum it up, I am a tech enthusiast who is eager to learn and contribute to our collective growth.
